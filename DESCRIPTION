Description: Implementation of the Laplace enriched multiple importance 
    estimator (LEMIE) algorithm and alternatives, with examples. LEMIE 
    facilitates sample-based posterior inference when data are partitioned and 
    samples have been drawn (using MCMC, for example) from local posterior 
    distributions (those conditioned on isolated parts of the data).
